# Bristol City Council Technical Questions

Answers for the technical questions below:

1.Did you have time to complete the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
* I would have provide alternate solutions to validate out code number and number of permits using regular expressions.
* Add a separate method to print the permit calculation summary.
* Add log4j.jar to print the logs.

2.What's your favourite programming language? Why?
> Java is my favourite programming language at the moment,due to the fact that it's my first Object Oriented Programming Language
 and it has opened countless ways of thinking and approaches to problem solving that I would have otherwise never encountered.Unlike c++ 
 you can simply compile your code without thinking too much about linking, optimisation and all sorts of other usual compiler features. It is 
 Open Source and their is good community ready to help. Also, Intelligent IDE support such as Netbeans, Eclipse makes coding much easier.
 Overall it is simple,secure,portable and high performance language.  
 
 3.Which of the SOLID principles do you feel is most important? Why?
>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the most important SOLID principles. There are number of reasons why it is important
* Code complexity is reduced by being more explicit and straightforward.
* Readability is greatly improved.
* Coupling is generally reduced.
* Your code has a better chance of cleanly evolving.

4.What technology are you reviewing/evaluating/playing with at the moment? Why does this interest you?
Technologies I am interested are 
* Bootstrap framework for developing responsive website. I have created my CV website using this technology.(www.vimaldavid.com)
* Liquibase for source controlling the database. Currently I am using this technology in my project.
* SWIFT ios programming language. I am taking an online course in Udemy to develop ios applications.
* Apart from this, I am playing around with Maven,GIT,Jenkins and JIRA. 

5.How would you track down a performance bottleneck in an application? Have you ever had to do this?
> We can use profilers to track down the performance bottleneck in an application. Yes I had used Jprofiler to resolve performance bottlenecks,pin
 down memory leaks and to understand threading issues.
